(CNN)Former Vice President Joe Biden responded for the first time on Sunday to allegations
that he made a Nevada politician feel "uneasy" in 2014 when he kissed her on the back of her head,
 saying that he never believed he acted inappropriately.
"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes,
 hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort," Biden said in a statement. "And not once -
 never - did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention."
The statement was the first response to the allegations directly from the former vice president.
Previously there have only been statements from Biden's spokesman.
