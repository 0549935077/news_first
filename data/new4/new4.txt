Ukrainian voters will be greeted with a mesmerizing docket in the voting booth: a dermatologist,
a trained spy, a former tax chief on trial over corruption, a self-proclaimed Cossack military
commander of Ukraine, an anchorwoman, a comedian and a few filthy rich oligarchs. To round out
the ballot is Illia Kyva, criminally convicted of bribery (but later granted amnesty) and who
has a penchant for homophobic posts on Facebook and posting his naked muscular torso on Instagram.
